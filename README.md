Testing
The website was properly tested and shows to work well. It scores well in the areas of performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.

Validator Testing
HTML
one errors message was returned when passed through the official W3C validator. It say I had a 

"Stray end tag section. From line 154, column 5; to line 154, column 14
/div>↩    </section>↩↩ " I had to go back and fix that.


CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, I navigated to the Settings tab,
From the source section drop-down menu, I selected the Main Branch and clicked Save.
The page was automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
The live link can be found here - https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html.

After the first deployment, I noticed the images on my deployed site didn't load. I found someone on the Slack community who told me the problem is from using absolute file paths and that I had spaces in the names of my image files. I fixed the errors and redeployed and it worked fine this time.

Credits
First, I had a lot of insight from the Love Running and the Coders Coffeehouse projects while working on this portfolio project.
I also give lots of credit to Ulrike Riemenschneider whose CREATIVE SPACES project was very helpful to.
And of course, of course, my mentor Jack Wachira whose help was invaluable as well. I thank all of them so much.
